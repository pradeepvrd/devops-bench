"""Re-score stored runs whose grade was produced by a broken judge or detector.

Unlike :mod:`renormalize_rows`, which only re-derives the flat row contract from
scores already recorded, this **re-runs the metrics** — and for the judged ones
that means real model calls. It needs no cluster and no agent: every input it
uses (``output``, ``expected_output``, ``verification_report``, the trajectory)
is already in ``results.json``.

Two defects make a stored grade wrong rather than merely stale:

* **A judge that never answered.** With ``JUDGE_MODEL`` pointing at an id the
  endpoint does not serve, every GEval raised and each unjudged item was counted
  as a *failure*. The signature is unmistakable, and selecting on it is the
  default: a ``ChecklistScore`` reported beside **zero** ``Check:`` keys. Those
  verdicts do not exist anywhere, so they cannot be recomputed — only re-asked.
  Pass ``--all`` to re-judge every run regardless.
* **A detector false positive.** Merely listing the home directory, or reading
  the task's own delivered input, flagged runs that read nothing they should not
  have; the integrity gate then zeroed an otherwise good score. Re-scanning is
  local and free.

The original ``results.json`` is copied to ``results.pre-rejudge.json`` before
anything is written, so the published record stays auditable.

**Requires two fixes to be present in the tree**: the checklist withholding an
unjudged item instead of failing it, and the detector's prompt-authorization
filters. Without them this re-runs the same broken judge and the same rules,
and faithfully reproduces the numbers it was meant to correct — so ``--check``
verifies both before any work, and ``--write`` refuses without them.

Usage::

    uv run python scripts/rejudge_runs.py <root> --check     # inspect only
    uv run python scripts/rejudge_runs.py <root>             # dry run
    uv run python scripts/rejudge_runs.py <root> --write     # re-judge and save
