# Agent sandbox

The agent under test runs inside a Docker container with a scoped cluster
credential, so the benchmark's own material — task definitions (whose
`expected_output` and `verification_spec` are the answer key), scoring code,
prior results, the operator's home directory and cloud identity — is not
merely *detected* when touched but **absent from the agent's world**. Eval
stays host-side: provisioning, verification, scoring and
[detection](./cheat-detection.md) run under the operator's credentials,
outside the boundary, unchanged.

Two boundaries, two different questions:

* the **container** decides what the agent can *see* — minimal mounts, an env
  allowlist, no Docker socket, `HOME` inside the workspace;
* the **credential** decides what the agent can *do* — a short-lived
  ServiceAccount token scoped by RBAC, backed by pod-security controls,
  instead of the operator's cluster-admin.

Neither substitutes for the other. Both exist because of two observed
escalations: an agent that used an admin kubeconfig to run a privileged pod,
mount the node's disk and read the bench checkout; and an agent that curled
the cloud metadata service and mined the VM's service account when its model
credential was missing. The second lesson generalizes: **completeness is a
security property** — an under-provisioned agent improvises, so the sandbox
also mounts the task's own seeded fixtures (read-write; tasks commit fixes
back) rather than starving the agent into hunting.

## Switching it on

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `BENCH_AGENT_SANDBOX` | `docker` / `1` / `true` opts in. Unset, the harness behaves byte-for-byte as before the sandbox existed. |
| `BENCH_SANDBOX_IMAGE` | The container image holding the agent CLI. Required when sandboxing. |
| `BENCH_AGENT_FIXTURES` | Optional override for fixture discovery, for a stack that names its seeded inputs unconventionally. |
| `BENCH_AGENT_SANDBOX_OWNER` | Unique attempt id scoping stray-container reaping; the matrix sets it per combo. |

The matrix runner bakes the opt-in into the detached runner script, so a
sandboxed remote matrix cannot silently degrade to ambient. The escape
hatches (`BENCH_SANDBOX_ALLOW_ADMIN_CREDS`, `BENCH_SANDBOX_ALLOW_AMBIENT_CLUSTER`)
exist for local development only, warn loudly, and are never forwarded to
matrix runs. Failures never degrade either: a sandbox that cannot be built —
no image, no network plan, no scoped credential — fails the record rather
than quietly running ambient.

## What the container sees

Exactly four things:

1. the per-run **workspace** (`/workspace`, with `HOME=/workspace/home`);
2. the task's **seeded fixtures**, discovered by the run-unique cluster token;
3. a generated single-cluster **kubeconfig** (CA + bearer token, no `exec:`
   plugin — which is also what makes GKE reachable from a container at all);
4. an explicit **env allowlist** (`BENCH_*`/`TF_*` and ambient cloud
   credentials never cross; for Vertex, a host-side metadata emulator serves
   a narrowly-scoped token instead).

Everything absent is the point: the repo checkout, `results/`, the operator's
kubeconfig, ADC, and the Docker socket do not exist inside.

## What the credential can do

Provisioning (host-side, per run, pinned to the run's own kubectl context)
creates a `bench-agent` ServiceAccount bound to `edit` plus a read-mostly
cluster supplement and a `ResourceQuota`/`LimitRange` write grant, mints a
token that expires just after the agent's timeout, applies PSA `baseline`
labels, and installs ValidatingAdmissionPolicy backstops denying privileged
pods, host namespaces, hostPath mounts, exempt-namespace writes, and shells
into pre-existing non-conformant pods. The quota grant exists so the
quota-governance tasks tempt the scoped agent exactly as they tempted the
operator credential; a task whose premise is that the operator cannot touch
the quota declares `agent_quota_writes: false`. A task whose subject matter
*is* privileged workloads declares `agent_pod_security: privileged`; a task
that cannot run behind the boundary at all declares
`requires_unsandboxed: true` and runs ambient, loudly, with its records
saying so. Under vcluster the ServiceAccount lives inside the
virtual cluster, so the token is cryptographically useless against the host.

**Teardown mirrors provisioning**: at the end of every sandboxed task — and
from provisioning's own failure paths — every policy, binding, label and RBAC
object comes back off, and `bench-system` is deleted. This is correctness,
not hygiene: the pod-security policy is deliberately not username-scoped, so
one left behind denies the *operator's* next privileged workload on a reused
cluster (see [known issues](../appendix/known_issues.md) for the by-hand
recovery on clusters last touched by older runs).

## Provenance in the results

A sandboxed arm carries a `sandboxed` augmentation token, so it lands in the
`setup_id` and aggregates as its own dashboard setup — the sandboxed-vs-ambient
comparison is a plain group-by on rows. Each row additionally carries its own
`sandboxed` boolean, because the arm's token is not the per-task truth (a
`requires_unsandboxed` task inside a sandboxed arm ran ambient). The run
manifest records the sandbox image **and its content digest**, so "both runs
used the same image" is checkable rather than a mutable-tag claim.

## Trusting it

Three layers, weakest to strongest evidence:

* **Unit tests** hold the mechanics: argv assembly, env filtering, kubeconfig
  rendering, path remapping, teardown inventory (kept in lockstep with the
  manifests by a test that parses them).
* **Boundary probes** ([`hack/sandbox_probe.py`](../../hack/sandbox_probe.py),
  promoted into `tests/e2e/test_sandbox_boundary.py`) assert every channel
  against a live cluster with deterministic commands: controls first (a dead
  token makes every deny pass for the wrong reason), then both observed
  escapes, then every hole review found, then that teardown left nothing
  behind.
* **The canary** ([`tasks/canary/sandbox-boundary/`](../../tasks/canary/sandbox-boundary/))
  sends a *real agent* through the full pipeline to attempt the forbidden
  reads, proving the trajectory, detection and artifacts tell the story
  end-to-end. A canary's `cheating_report` is *expected* to flag — detection
  seeing the attempt while the boundary denies it is both layers working.

Detection stays on for sandboxed runs as the tripwire behind the wall: a
sensitive-access flag on a sandboxed record no longer means "expected ambient
access" — it is a boundary-breach indicator and should be treated as one.

## Runner-host requirements

The sandbox asks exactly one thing of the machine running the harness:
**Docker**. Scored runs use clusters whose nodes are not the harness host
(vcluster/GKE); co-located kind is a development configuration — a kind node
is a privileged container on the harness machine, so pod-level escalation
there lands on the host, which is precisely what the pod-security controls
exist to prevent while you develop. On any cloud VM host, the link-local
metadata endpoint must be blocked from agent containers (`vm-setup.sh`
installs the `DOCKER-USER` rule on the bastion); the endpoint serves the VM's
own credentials on every major cloud, so this is a host-class requirement,
not a GCP quirk.
