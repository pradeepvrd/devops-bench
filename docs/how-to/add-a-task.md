# How to add a task

A benchmark task is a typed contract on disk. You author one directory under `tasks/<provider>/<name>/` containing a single `task.yaml`, and the harness does the rest: it validates the file against the `Task` schema, substitutes infrastructure placeholders, optionally provisions a cluster, runs the agent, and grades the result.

This guide walks you through the schema, the placeholders the harness fills in, the step-by-step authoring flow, two complete worked examples, and the considerations that keep your task safe to run alongside dozens of others. The schema is enforced by `Task` in `devops_bench/tasks/schema.py` and tasks are discovered and loaded by `FileSystemTaskLoader`. If anything here ever disagrees with that schema, the schema wins — and you should fix the doc.

For background terms, see the [glossary](../components/glossary.md). For how deployers and stacks fit together, see [infrastructure](../components/infra.md).

## The task schema

Every field below maps to an attribute on `Task`. Fields marked "required" must produce a usable value — the harness validates types strictly (no string-to-bool coercion) and ignores unknown keys, so a typo'd field name is silently dropped rather than flagged. Author carefully.

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task_id` (alias `id`) | Yes | Unique identifier for the task. `task_id` is accepted as an alias for `id` and is coerced to a string. |
| `name` | Yes | Human-readable task name. Defaults to the directory name when omitted, but set it explicitly. |
| `prompt` (aliases `goal`, `input`) | Yes | The instruction handed to the agent. Use `{{...}}` placeholders for any infra value — never hardcode a project, cluster, namespace, or deployment name. |
| `expected_output` | Yes | The grading rubric, written as prose "critical requirements". Graded on **outcome**, so accept any valid path to the goal, not one prescribed method. |
| `infrastructure` | Yes | `{deployer, stack, teardown, variables, provider?}`. Use `deployer: noop` for generation-only tasks (no cluster) or `deployer: tofu` with a `stack` under `tf/prebuilt/<dir>` to provision real infrastructure. |
| `validated` | No (defaults `false`) | Set `true` only after a human has vetted the task. Required for leaderboard eligibility — an unvetted task never counts. |
| `verification_spec` | No | A list of `{name, spec: <typed node>}` entries. Deterministic cluster assertions; `name` is the cross-reference key a `chaos_spec` resolves against. |
| `chaos_spec` | No | A list of `{name, trigger, action, verify}` entries, where `verify` matches a `verification_spec` entry's `name`. |
| `documentation` | No | `[{doc_name, url, constraints: [{text, critical}]}]` — reference docs and the requirements drawn from them, used for grounding scoring. |
| `retrieval_context` | No | A list of supporting passages for retrieval-based (RAG) scoring. |

> [!NOTE]
> An empty YAML block (`key:` with no value) is treated as the field's empty default rather than an error, so you can stub out an optional field without breaking validation.

## Placeholders

The harness substitutes a fixed set of `{{...}}` placeholders into your `prompt` and `expected_output` (and into chaos/verification spec string leaves) just before the agent runs, using the live cluster and project for that run.

| Placeholder | Resolves to |
| --- | --- |
| `{{PROJECT_ID}}` / `{{GCP_PROJECT_ID}}` | The active GCP project ID. |
| `{{CLUSTER_NAME}}` / `{{GKE_CLUSTER_NAME}}` | The active cluster name for this run. |
| `{{APP_LOCATION}}` | The configured application location. |
| `{{TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}` | The deployment the agent operates on (and the chaos port-forward target). |
| `{{NAMESPACE}}` | The namespace the target workload lives in. |

Write everything infra-specific as a placeholder. That is what lets the *same* task run against a different project and a freshly named cluster on every invocation, and in parallel with other runs, without edits. A hardcoded cluster name or project ID will break the moment the task runs anywhere but your machine.

## Step by step

1. **Create the file.** Make `tasks/<provider>/<name>/task.yaml`. Set `task_id` (unique) and `name`.
2. **Choose a deployer.** Use `noop` for a manifest-generation task (the agent's YAML is judged, never applied — no cluster is brought up). Use `tofu` with a `stack` under `tf/prebuilt/<dir>` when the agent needs a live cluster; create a new stack directory or reuse an existing one.
3. **Write the `prompt`** using placeholders only for any infra value.
4. **Write `expected_output`** as outcome-based "critical requirements" — describe *what* a correct result must achieve, not the exact commands to get there.
5. **(Optional) Add a `verification_spec` and `chaos_spec`.** Express deterministic cluster assertions as compound `sequence` / `parallel` nodes wrapping leaf verifiers like `pod_healthy` and `scaling_complete`. If you inject chaos, set the chaos entry's `verify:` to match a `verification_spec` entry's `name`.
6. **(Optional) Add `documentation`** entries to ground scoring against authoritative docs.
7. **Smoke-test with no infra.** This forces the `noop` deployer and skips provisioning, so it's fast and free:
   ```bash
   BENCH_NO_INFRA=true python -m devops_bench tasks/<provider>/<name>/task.yaml
   ```
8. **Run for real, review the scores, then promote.** Once you've run the task against real infra and are satisfied with the grading, set `validated: true`.

## A complete example

Here is a realistic, annotated `noop` generation task. The agent is asked to produce manifests; nothing is provisioned, and the YAML it generates is what gets graded. Note that every infra value is a placeholder, and `expected_output` lists outcome requirements rather than prescribing exact field values.

```yaml
task_id: 2
name: "create-deployment"
# deployer: noop skips provisioning — the agent's generated YAML is judged,
# never applied. generation_only is derived automatically from deployer == noop.
infrastructure:
  deployer: "noop"
prompt: "Generate a Kubernetes manifest for deploying our finetuned model to GKE cluster {{GKE_CLUSTER_NAME}}. The models are stored in GCS bucket models-{{GCP_PROJECT_ID}}. Ensure it can scale up and down with traffic."
expected_output: |
  critical requirements:

  - Deploy a vLLM server for the model.
  - Configure the deployment to use 1 NVIDIA L4 GPU and the 'nvidia.com/gpu' toleration.
  - Mount the model bucket 'models-{{GCP_PROJECT_ID}}' using the gcsfuse CSI driver.
  - Create a 'ClusterIP' Service exposing the server on a feasible port.
  - Create an HPA with feasible scaling parameters (max replicas, CPU utilization).
  - Use a dedicated service account for the deployment.
# Optional: ground scoring against authoritative docs.
documentation:
  - doc_name: "GPU Setup Docs"
    url: "https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/gpus"
    constraints:
      - text: "nvidia.com/gpu resource limit of 1"
        critical: true
      - text: "nvidia.com/gpu toleration"
        critical: true
```

For a task that needs a live cluster, swap the `infrastructure` block for a `tofu` deployer with a stack, and pair a `chaos_spec` with a `verification_spec`. The snippet below provisions a workload, fires a planned load spike five seconds in, and then verifies — in parallel — that pods stay healthy and the deployment scales out. The chaos entry's `verify:` value is the cross-reference key; it **must** match the `name` of a `verification_spec` entry.

```yaml
infrastructure:
  deployer: "tofu"
  stack: "prebuilt/optimize-scale"
  teardown: true
  variables:
    namespace: "default"
    target_deployment_name: "scale-target"
chaos_spec:
  - name: "Planned Load Spike"
    trigger:
      type: time
      delay_seconds: 5
    action:
      type: generate_load
      target:
        service_url: "http://{{TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}.{{NAMESPACE}}.svc.cluster.local"
        qps: 300
    # Resolved against verification_spec[*].name below.
    verify: "Planned Load Spike Verification"
verification_spec:
  - name: "Planned Load Spike Verification"
    spec:
      type: parallel
      name: "Planned Load Spike Verification"
      checks:
        - type: pod_healthy
          name: pod_spec
          selector: "app={{TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}"
          namespace: "{{NAMESPACE}}"
        - type: scaling_complete
          name: scaling_spec
          deployment: "{{TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}"
          min_replicas: 2
          namespace: "{{NAMESPACE}}"
```

> [!NOTE]
> A typo'd `verify:` (no matching `verification_spec` name) does not crash the run — it's recorded as a verification parse error on the result. Check that your cross-references line up before you rely on them.

## Key considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Parallel safety is non-negotiable.** Tasks run concurrently across a matrix of models and configs. Any GCP-global resource your task creates must be run-scoped — derive its name from `var.cluster_name` or a random suffix — and it must be destroyed at teardown. A fixed, shared name means two concurrent runs collide and both fail. Keep `variables.namespace` and `variables.target_deployment_name` in your stack consistent with the `{{NAMESPACE}}` and `{{TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}` placeholders in your prompt, or the agent and the chaos injector will address different workloads.

A few more habits that keep tasks healthy:

- **Grade on outcome, not method.** Write `expected_output` so any correct path scores well. If your rubric only credits one specific command sequence, you're testing recall, not capability.
- **Leave `validated: false` until you've actually run it.** The flag gates leaderboard inclusion; promoting an unvetted task pollutes the results.
- **Prefer `noop` when a cluster adds nothing.** Generation-only tasks are faster, cheaper, and inherently collision-free.

## Reviewing and validating your task

Before you submit, run the `task-review` skill (in `.agents/skills/`) over your task. It checks the
schema and rubric quality and, most importantly, hunts the parallel-safety problems above — shared
state that would make your task fail when the full matrix runs at once. It's review-only: static
analysis plus maybe unit tests and linters, never provisioning infra or running an eval. (For changes
to the harness *code* rather than a task, use `devops-bench-review` instead.)

To actually prove the task runs and grades correctly, use the `validate-eval` skill, which runs it in
a self-healing loop and recommends setting `validated: true` once it's green. See the [skills section
in getting started](../getting-started.md#skills-in-this-repo) for how to invoke them.
