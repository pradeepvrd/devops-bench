# Reusable, harness-agnostic GCE bastion for running the eval harness.
#
# The bastion is a plain Compute Engine VM (NOT Cloud Workstations). It runs as a
# dedicated service account and, via its startup script, installs the full
# harness toolchain plus the openclaw `oc` binary, so the whole harness runs on
# the VM and invokes `oc` as a local subprocess. SSH is reached over IAP.
#
# It deliberately mirrors the plain-Compute patterns in tf/modules/gke (the agent
# service account + the IAP-SSH firewall rule).
