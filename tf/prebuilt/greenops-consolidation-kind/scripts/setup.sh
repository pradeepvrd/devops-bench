# Setup for the greenops-consolidation task. Runs from OUTSIDE the cluster during
# `tofu apply`, before the agent starts:
#   1. labels the four worker nodes with a machine family, two of each. The two
#      that sort first are 'n2d-standard-4' (the efficient gen4 family), the two
#      that sort last are 'n1-standard-4' (the power-hungry gen1 family). This is
#      the ONLY place in the cluster the two pools differ, and it is the join key
#      for the delivered carbon feed's per-family power figures,
#   2. waits for every worker to be Ready, then deploys a lightly-loaded fleet
#      across the cluster. The workloads carry soft hostname topology-spread
#      constraints so every worker ends up carrying a little load — the
#      underutilized, energy-wasteful "before" state the agent must consolidate,
#   3. waits for every Deployment to finish rolling out so the agent starts from a
#      complete fleet, then asserts the spread actually landed.
#
# The kubectl work isn't expressible as plan-time-safe declarative TF (kind has no
# cluster at plan time); the carbon report is delivered declaratively by a
# local_file resource in main.tf, not here.
#
# Nothing here tells the agent which nodes to drain, how far to consolidate, or
# that draining is the mechanism at all. It must read the feed, join it to the
# node labels, inspect the workloads' scheduling constraints, and decide itself.
