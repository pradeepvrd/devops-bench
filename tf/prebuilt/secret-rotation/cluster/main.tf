# service account holding exactly the two roles the rotation needs, on exactly
# this run's secret. The harness impersonates it to mint a short-lived token
# for the container; the provisioning identity is granted tokenCreator on it
# here, an SA-level binding that tears down with the run's own SA — not a
# shared project-level grant for concurrent runs to fight over.

# 10. Runner identity: BYO credentials.
#
# The agent runs as the operator-provided broad runner identity (the bastion VM
# SA, assumed pre-provisioned with the infra permissions it needs). This stack
# intentionally grants that identity NOTHING: adding per-run/project bindings to
# a shared SA is what caused concurrent runs to fight at teardown (one run's
# destroy revoked the binding the other still needed). A least-privilege,
# per-run runner SA is a tracked follow-up. The per-run resources above (the
# workload SA + secret) are name-suffixed via random_id so concurrent runs of
# this task never collide.
