# Setup for the opa-remediation task. Runs from OUTSIDE the cluster during
# `tofu apply`, before the agent starts:
#   1. installs Kyverno (the Policy-as-Code engine),
#   2. applies two AUDIT-mode compliance policies (disallow-privileged,
#      require-resource-limits): audit so existing violations are *reported*, not
#      blocked,
#   3. deploys team workloads that violate those policies (live in the cluster),
#   4. seeds a local bare git repo (the GitOps source of truth) with the workload
#      manifests for the agent to remediate.
#
# Nothing here tells the agent what is wrong. It must scan the policy reports and
# discover the violations itself.
