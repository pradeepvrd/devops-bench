"""API/MCP agent harness driving the shared :func:`run_tool_loop` primitive.

The concrete harness lives in :mod:`devops_bench.agents.api.agent` and
self-registers under ``"api"`` via ``@AGENTS.register``. That module and its
siblings (:mod:`devops_bench.agents.api.mcp`,
:mod:`devops_bench.agents.api.skills`) pull in heavy optional dependencies (the
``mcp`` SDK, ``deepeval``) only at call time — importing this package never
forces those imports.
