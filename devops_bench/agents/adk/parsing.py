"""Parser for the serialized ADK event stream.

An ADK run yields ``Event`` objects; the harness serializes each one and hands
the resulting list here. Working on plain mappings rather than SDK objects keeps
this module import-light (no ``google.adk`` dependency) and lets the tests
exercise the fold against recorded event dumps.

Each event carries a ``content.parts`` list. Three part shapes matter:

| Part shape          | Meaning                                              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| ``function_call``   | The model asked for a tool (``id``, ``name``, ``args``) |
| ``function_response`| The tool answered (``id``, ``name``, ``response``)   |
| ``text``            | Assistant prose                                      |

Calls and responses are correlated by the ``id`` ADK stamps on both sides, so a
call and its result fold into one :class:`~devops_bench.agents.result.ToolCall`
rather than two trajectory entries.

Three event-level fields outside ``content`` carry the run's telemetry:
``timestamp`` (epoch seconds, on every event), ``usage_metadata`` (one block per
LLM call), and ``model_version`` (the id the provider reported, on the events
the model authored).
