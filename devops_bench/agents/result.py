            tool failed. The antigravity parser also emits ``"interrupted"``

    Attributes:
        output: Final assistant text the judge grades.
        trajectory: Ordered list of ``ToolCall.to_dict()`` entries. Every agent
            emits the same canonical entry shape so metrics consume one schema.
        tokens: Provider-reported token usage (shape is provider-defined; pass
            through verbatim).
        latency: Wall-clock seconds of the agent turn itself. A harness that
            can measure the span more precisely than the whole ``run()`` call
            -- the CLI harnesses bracket their subprocess -- stamps this in
            ``_execute``; :meth:`AgentHarness.run` backfills the whole-run
            elapsed only when it was left at zero.
        errors: Human-readable error or extraction-failure messages. **Empty**
            on a clean run; populated when a known-error path (subprocess
            failure, parse miss, timeout) is reached — never silently dropped.
        terminal_reason: Why the run stopped; one of :data:`TERMINAL_REASONS`,
            rejected with ``ValueError`` otherwise. A run the harness cut off at
            its wall-clock budget scores like a wrong answer, so without this an
            efficiency ceiling reads as a capability failure.
        tool_wait_sec: Wall-clock seconds the run spent inside tool calls, with
            concurrent calls counted once, or ``None`` when the transcript
            carried no timings. ``latency`` alone cannot separate a slow model
            from a slow environment, and the leaderboard ranks on latency.
        served_models: Model ids the provider actually answered with, in
            first-seen order. Config names the *requested* model; an agent may
            fail over to another model mid-run, and a requested alias can
            resolve to a dated or preview id, so without this a leaderboard
            attributes a score to the wrong model. Empty when the harness
            reports none.
        model_turns: How many times the model was called, or ``None`` when the
            harness cannot tell. Distinct from ``len(trajectory)``: one model
            turn can issue several tool calls at once, and a turn that only
            writes text issues none. On an agentic loop the whole conversation
            is re-sent every turn, so this is what input tokens grow with.
        metadata: Agent-specific extras (e.g. raw provider stats, session ids)
            that do not fit the typed fields above.
