"""Agents under evaluation and the agent-selection registry.

Each concrete harness lives in a sibling module named after its canonical key
(``cli.gemini``/``cli.openclaw``) and self-registers under it via
``@AGENTS.register``. Those modules pull in heavy optional dependencies
(``deepeval``), so they are imported only when the agent is selected, never on
package import.
