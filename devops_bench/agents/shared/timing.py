    """Parse a transcript event timestamp into epoch seconds.

    Two spellings reach here: CLI transcripts stamp ISO-8601 (``Z`` suffix or an
    explicit offset), and the in-process ADK event stream stamps epoch seconds as
    a ``float`` already. A stamp carrying no offset is read as UTC, so the result
    never depends on the runner's local zone.

    Args:
        value: The raw ``ts`` / ``timestamp`` field, or anything else.

    Returns:
        Epoch seconds, or ``None`` when the value is missing or unparseable. A
        transcript that drops the field is normal on older CLI versions, so this
        is a "no timing available" signal, not an error.

    """Return the wall-clock seconds covered by ``intervals``, overlaps counted once.

    Agents dispatch tool calls in batches: a single model turn can issue several
    calls stamped at the same millisecond that then run concurrently. Summing
    their durations would report more tool time than the run took in total, so
    overlapping intervals are merged before measuring.

    Args:
        intervals: ``(start, end)`` epoch-second pairs, in any order. Pairs whose
            end precedes their start are dropped as clock skew.

    Returns:
        Seconds of wall clock inside at least one interval, or ``None`` when no
        usable interval was supplied — distinct from ``0.0``, which means the
        tools ran and returned within the transcript's resolution.
