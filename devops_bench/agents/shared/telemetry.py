    Every harness parser returns this, so a new telemetry column is added once
    here rather than once per harness. Fields carry the semantics documented on
    :class:`~devops_bench.agents.result.AgentResult`; only the deviations are
    restated below.

    Attributes:
        output: The agent's final answer text; ``""`` when none was found.
        trajectory: ``ToolCall.to_dict()`` mappings, in emission order.
        tokens: Canonical token buckets summed over the run.
        errors: Decode failures, unmatched tool results, and any failure the
            transcript itself reported.
        tool_wait_sec: Best-effort: a call whose two envelopes are not both
            timestamped contributes nothing, so a partially stamped transcript
            reports a lower bound.
        served_models: Read from the transcript, which names the id the provider
            answered with rather than the one requested.
        model_turns: ``None`` when the transcript carried nothing to count.
        terminal_reason: ``""`` unless the transcript itself said why the run
            stopped -- only the Claude CLI does, and even there a truncated pipe
            leaves it empty. The harness resolves the rest from the exit code,
            and ``"timeout"`` is always its own verdict.
