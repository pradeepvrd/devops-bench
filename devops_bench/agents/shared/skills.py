"""Frontmatter parsing for ``SKILL.md`` files, shared by every agent.

Both the API agent (advertising skills as synthetic tools) and the CLI agents
(materializing skills into the launched CLI) need a skill file's ``name`` and
``description``; keeping the parser here lets either import it without reaching
into the other's package. Importing this module pulls no provider SDK.
