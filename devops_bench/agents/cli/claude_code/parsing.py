    The stream is newline-delimited JSON in the wrapped SDK form: each line is
    an envelope with a top-level ``type`` (``system`` / ``assistant`` / ``user``
    / ``result``) carrying a nested Anthropic ``message`` object. The parser is
    intentionally lenient (unknown event types are skipped) and surfaces both
    per-line JSON decode errors and unmatched ``tool_result`` blocks on the
    ``errors`` list rather than dropping them.

    | Event type    | Handling                                                  |
    |---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

    |               | ``message.id`` → model turns; ``message.model`` → served; |

    ``assistant`` and ``user`` envelopes carry a top-level ISO-8601
    ``timestamp``, so pairing a ``tool_use`` block with the ``tool_result`` that
    answers it gives the run a real tool wait. The terminal event's
    ``duration_ms``/``duration_api_ms`` are deliberately *not* used for this:
    they measure concurrent work independently and their difference goes
    negative on a real run (observed: 4901ms wall against 6553ms of API time).

    The accumulated assistant ``text`` doubles as a fallback answer when no
    terminal ``result`` event arrives (a truncated pipe) or when it carries an
    empty answer (error subtypes emit ``""``). Likewise token usage falls back to
    the per-turn accumulator only when the terminal event reports no usage;
    per-turn usage is deduped by message id, since Claude Code repeats the same
    ``usage`` on every content-block envelope of one API message. That fallback
    recovers the prompt-side buckets only (see :data:`_ACC_USAGE_KEYS`).

    Args:
        stdout: Raw process stdout, possibly empty.

    Returns:
        A :class:`~devops_bench.agents.shared.telemetry.ParsedRun`.
        ``model_turns`` counts distinct assistant ``message.id`` values, which
        is *not* the terminal event's ``num_turns``: the CLI emits one envelope
        per content block, so one API message answering with two ``tool_use``
        blocks raises ``num_turns`` by two while the model was called once.
        ``served_models`` is read from the assistant envelopes rather than the
        terminal event's ``modelUsage``, whose keys also include the CLI's own
        internal helper model (observed: a ``claude-haiku-4-5`` entry on a run
        answered entirely by ``claude-opus-5``).

    *inside* ``output_tokens`` and counted again under
    ``output_tokens_details.thinking_tokens``, so it is subtracted back out to
    honour the contract that ``output`` excludes ``reasoning`` while ``total``
    stays exact. Without that details block ``reasoning`` stays ``None`` rather
    than a fabricated ``0``.

    ``total`` is only filled in once ``output`` is known. The accumulator path
    leaves that bucket unreported on purpose (see :data:`_ACC_USAGE_KEYS`), and
    a prompt-side-only sum published under ``total`` reaches the dashboard row
    verbatim — an absent total beats one that undercounts the whole output side.
