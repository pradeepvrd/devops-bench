"""OpenClaw CLI agent harness driving the ``oc`` binary (local-only).

Capability wiring is delivered through openclaw's native channels, laid down in
a per-run temp dir:

* **State isolation** — ``OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`` points at ``<run>/state`` so
  sessions and the skills root live in the per-run dir.
* **MCP servers** — command-bearing bindings become ``mcp.servers`` entries in
  ``<run>/openclaw.json``, selected via ``OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH``.
* **Skills** — ``config.capabilities.skills.paths`` are materialized under
  ``<OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md``.
* **Rules** — ``config.capabilities.rules.text`` is prepended to the prompt
  (the ``oc`` build has no dedicated system-prompt flag).
* **Model catalog** — models openclaw doesn't ship in its built-in catalog
  (e.g. ``gemini-3.5-flash``) are registered in the same per-run
  ``<run>/openclaw.json`` so a run never depends on a global
  ``oc models``/``configure-oc.sh`` step. The entry is written for whichever
  Google backend ``config.provider`` selects — ``google`` (google-genai) or
  ``google-vertex`` (Vertex AI).
* **Model auth** — ``config.api_key`` is threaded into the provider env var
  (``GEMINI_API_KEY``/``GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY``/``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``/...) that
  ``oc agent --local`` reads.

Trajectory extraction uses the official session commands documented in
``docs/openclaw/sessions.md``: run ``oc agent --local``, locate the single
session with ``oc sessions --json``, export it with
``oc sessions export-trajectory``, and parse the bundle. On any extraction miss
the failure is recorded on ``AgentResult.errors`` rather than returning a
silent-empty trajectory.

The bundle parsing lives in :mod:`~devops_bench.agents.cli.openclaw.parsing`.

``__init__`` assigns ``self.rules``, ``self.mcp_servers`` and ``self.skills``
from the granted bindings, so the agent structurally satisfies
``SupportsRules`` / ``SupportsMcp`` / ``SupportsSkills``.

    Confirmed live against openclaw 2026.9.1-beta.1 + anthropic-vertex-provider
    2026.9.1-beta.1 (the first pairing where the plugin is correctly discovered
    as a stock plugin -- see the Dockerfile comment): even with valid ADC
    credentials on disk and the ``gcp-vertex-credentials`` marker pinned on
    ``models.providers.anthropic-vertex.apiKey`` (see :data:`_PROVIDER_TRANSPORT`),
    a bare run still aborts with ``ProviderAuthError: No API key found for
    provider "anthropic-vertex"``. This version introduced a per-agent SQLite
    auth-profile store that gates model auth *before* the plugin's own
    ADC-detecting ``resolveSyntheticAuth`` hook is consulted, so the marker in
    config is no longer sufficient on its own -- an explicit profile entry must
    exist in that store too.

    That gate is **not plugin-specific**: a keyless ``google-vertex`` run aborts
    the same way (``No API key found for provider "google-vertex"``, confirmed
    live on 2026-09-10 against the same version), because the store is consulted
    for every provider before any ADC resolution happens. So the profile is
    seeded for any Vertex-backend provider on a keyless run, not just the
    Anthropic one. Seeding it does not make the run keyed: the pasted value is
    :data:`_VERTEX_CREDENTIALS_MARKER`, and the turn only succeeds because the
    transport then authenticates through ADC -- a real (wrong) key would 401.

    ``oc models auth paste-api-key --provider <id>`` registers that entry
    non-interactively (it reads the key from stdin, no TTY required), so it is
    safe to run unattended before every keyless Vertex turn (see
    :func:`_build_local_command`). A run carrying an explicit API key needs no
    profile and gets none.
