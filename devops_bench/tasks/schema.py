        title: Display name for the task; free to change, unlike ``name``.
        summary: A few plain sentences on the starting state, what the agent
            must do, and what done looks like. Run-invariant, like every
            display field: no placeholders.
        category: Primary bucket for filtering; one of :data:`CATEGORIES`.
        tags: Secondary facets for filtering.
        check_groups: Display groups that ``verification_spec`` entries may
            reference via ``group``; keyed by the group slug.
        prompt: Instruction text driving the agent.
        expected_output: Reference output the result is judged against.
        retrieval_context: Supporting passages for retrieval-based scoring.
        chaos_spec: Opaque chaos-injection specification parsed by the chaos
            subsystem; may be a mapping, list, or raw JSON string.
        verification_spec: A list of verification entry mappings, validated
            per entry downstream by ``parse_entries``.
        recoverable_safety: "Must-not-do" constraints whose violation is contained
            /reversible; judged like the correctness checklist and rolled into
            ``rec_v``. Catastrophic safeguards have no judged form and are
            declared deterministically in ``verification_spec`` instead.
        infrastructure: Deployer and stack settings for the task environment.
        documentation: Documentation entries, each with per-constraint criticality.
        agent_pod_security: Pod-security level enforced on the namespaces a
            sandboxed agent can reach: ``"baseline"`` (the default) or
            ``"privileged"`` to opt this task out entirely. Any other value is
            a validation error rather than a silent fall-back to the default.
            Only set ``"privileged"`` for a task whose own subject matter is
            privileged workloads -- it removes the control that denies the
            privileged-pod and hostPath escape.
        agent_quota_writes: Whether a sandboxed agent may create, change or
            delete ResourceQuota and LimitRange objects. Defaults to ``True``
            so a quota-governance task presents the same temptation under the
            scoped credential as under the operator's; set ``False`` for a
            task whose premise is that the operator cannot touch the quota.
        validated: Whether the task has been vetted as correct and is eligible to
            promote to the leaderboard. Defaults to ``False`` so an unvetted task
            never counts until explicitly marked.
        requires_unsandboxed: Opt this task out of the agent sandbox even when
            the run asks for one. For a task whose objective *is* the credential
            the sandbox withholds: ``secret-rotation`` drives Secret Manager
            through Application Default Credentials, and ADC is exactly what the
            boundary strips, so a sandboxed run cannot do the task at all.
            Declared on the task rather than passed per-run so the exemption
            travels with the thing that needs it and is visible to anyone
            reading the spec.
            never counts until explicitly marked. A validated task must carry
            the display metadata (``title``, ``summary``, ``category``, and a
            ``title`` and ``description`` on every verification entry), because
            the leaderboard renders validated tasks and nothing else.
