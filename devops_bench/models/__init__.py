"""LLM provider clients and the provider-selection factory.

Each provider has an adapter module named by model family (``gemini``,
``claude``; ``ollama`` is the runtime exception). A provider's SDK is imported
only when its adapter is constructed, so a missing SDK surfaces as
:class:`MissingDependencyError` at construction time, not on import.
