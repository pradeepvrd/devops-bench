"""Shared model-agnostic tool-use loop for agents and chaos.

:func:`run_tool_loop` drives an :class:`~devops_bench.models.base.LLMClient`
through repeated ``generate_content`` turns until the model stops requesting
tools or a safety cap is reached. Messages use a neutral shape:

- user turn:      ``{"role": "user", "content": goal}``
- assistant turn: ``{"role": "assistant", "content": text[, "tool_calls": [...]]}``
- tool result:    ``{"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": id, "name": name, "content": text}``

A function call (an entry in ``tool_calls``) is
``{"name": ..., "args": ..., "id": ...}``.
