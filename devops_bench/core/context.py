    This is the de-kinding seam. kind needs special knowledge (its Docker

    means something from a bridge-networked container. Providers answer with
    this plan via
    :meth:`~devops_bench.providers.base.Provider.sandbox_network_plan`, so the
    sandbox itself carries no per-provider knowledge.

    It lives beside :class:`ClusterInfo` rather than in
    :mod:`devops_bench.agents.sandbox` because both the provider layer and the
    credential minting in :mod:`devops_bench.k8s.agent_credentials` name the
    type, and having ``providers`` import from ``agents`` would invert the
    layering.

            ``host.docker.internal:host-gateway`` is always added regardless,
            so loopback-published endpoints stay reachable on Linux too.
        rewrite_server: Replacement apiserver URL for the generated
            kubeconfig, or ``None`` to keep the context's own server.
        tls_server_name: Value for the kubeconfig's ``tls-server-name`` when
            the rewritten endpoint's certificate carries a different SAN.
        kubectl_context: kubectl context every credential read for this plan
            is pinned to (``--context``). ``None`` falls back to the ambient
            current-context — only acceptable when the caller has no cluster
            identity of its own; the eval harness always pins, so a
            current-context switched under it (an operator, a parallel
