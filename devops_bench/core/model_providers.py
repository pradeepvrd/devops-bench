"""The single source of truth for agent model-provider config.

Every harness consumes the same ``AGENT_PROVIDER`` / ``AGENT_MODEL`` /
``AGENT_API_KEY`` contract through :func:`resolve_provider`, so a config that
works for one harness behaves identically for the others. A raw provider alias
resolves to a :class:`ProviderSpec` carrying both axes the harnesses need: the
adapter family (which models-layer client to build) and the backend / transport
/ key-routing details (which oc wire-provider, which API-key env var(s), and
whether the backend authenticates without a key).

Lives in ``core`` (not ``models``/``agents``) so both the models layer and the
CLI harnesses import it without an import cycle and without pulling any provider
SDK. Named ``model_providers`` to avoid confusion with
:mod:`devops_bench.providers` (the cloud/infra OpenTofu providers).

This module also owns the **mint-and-inject credential recipes** for the keyless
backends — see :func:`sandbox_credential_env`. A key-based provider needs
nothing from them (its key is already in the env overlay and crosses the sandbox
boundary by value); a keyless backend authenticates through ambient cloud
identity, which the sandbox deliberately strips, so it needs a host-side recipe
that mints a narrow short-lived credential and injects it explicitly. Per the
proposal's review rule, that cloud-specific code lives here — in the
model-credential layer — and never in :mod:`devops_bench.agents.sandbox`.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A sandboxed agent has no ambient cloud identity by construction: the
# operator's gcloud config is not mounted, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS and
# CLOUDSDK_CONFIG never cross the boundary, and on a cloud VM the link-local
# metadata endpoint is blocked to containers by the DOCKER-USER rule
# ``vm-setup.sh`` installs. That is the whole point — it is also why every
# Application Default Credentials lookup inside the container fails.
#
# For Vertex the recipe is a **metadata-server emulator**: a small host-side
# HTTP server speaking the subset of the GCE metadata protocol that Google's
# auth libraries use to obtain a token, backed by an impersonated token for a
# service account that holds ``roles/aiplatform.user`` and nothing else. The
# container is pointed at it with GCE_METADATA_HOST / GCE_METADATA_IP /
# METADATA_SERVER_DETECTION.
#
# Four simpler things were tried first and none of them work:
#
# * There is no supported way to hand the SDK a bare access token.
# * No ADC file format carries one — ``authorized_user`` needs a refresh token
#   and ``external_account`` needs a workload-identity pool.
# * ``GOOGLE_API_KEY`` + ``GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`` is Vertex *express mode*
#   only; a standard project answers ``401: API keys are not supported by this
#   API``.
# * Service-account key files are refused by
#   ``constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation``.

# Host-side env var naming the service account the emulator impersonates. It
# carries the ``BENCH_`` prefix deliberately: the sandbox deny filter drops
# that prefix, and this is operator configuration that has no business inside
# the container — only the minted token crosses.

# The emulator binds on all interfaces rather than loopback. It has to: on
# Linux the container reaches the host at the bridge gateway address, and a
