    """Verify HTTP reachability by curling the URL from inside the cluster.

    Launches an ephemeral ``curlimages/curl`` pod per attempt via
    ``kubectl run --rm`` and checks status code and, optionally, body content.
    In converge mode it retries a fresh pod until the expected response appears
    or the deadline passes; in assert and hold mode it fires exactly once. The
    request originates from inside the cluster, so this verifier validates
    ClusterIP/DNS reachability that a probe run from outside the cluster
    cannot reach. Reach for it when the service is not externally accessible;
    every use documents that the service can only be probed from inside the
    cluster.

    Attributes:
        type: Discriminator literal, always ``"http_probe"``.
        url: URL to probe (must be reachable from inside the cluster).
        expect_status: Expected HTTP status code; default 200.
        expect_body_matches: Optional regex applied to the response body. Only
            the first :data:`_BODY_MATCH_LIMIT_CHARS` characters are matched
            against, since the body is untrusted input.
        namespace: Namespace the ephemeral pod runs in; active context when None.
        probe_timeout: Seconds the curl command may run. The ``kubectl run``
            call is bounded by this value plus :data:`_KUBECTL_OVERHEAD_SEC`,
            clamped further to whatever remains on the converge deadline.
        host: Optional ``Host`` header value. Set this to probe a host-routed
            ingress path: ``url`` targets the edge/controller address while
            this header selects the virtual host. ``None`` (default) omits
            the header and preserves plain URL-based routing.
