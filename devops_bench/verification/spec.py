    much it counts (``weight``), and how it is evaluated (``mode``).

    Attributes:
        name: Unique label for this entry within its task.
        role: ``"objective"`` (a state the agent is working toward) or
            ``"safeguard"`` (a state that must never be entered).
        severity: Required for safeguards; unset for objectives.
        mode: How the check is evaluated. ``"converge"`` polls toward success
            until a deadline. ``"assert"`` evaluates once, after the agent's
            turn ends. ``"hold"`` requires the condition to hold continuously
            over some window, sampled repeatedly rather than evaluated once;
            what the window is depends on ``role`` (see ``hold_window_sec``
            below). Sampling cannot see a violation shorter than the poll
            interval between two samples; this is a fidelity limit, not a
            guarantee of continuous observation. Left unset, the mode is
            derived from ``role``.
        weight: How much this entry counts toward its role's score.
        check: The parsed check subtree.
        hold_poll_interval_sec: Seconds between samples for a ``hold`` entry.
            Ignored for every other mode. ``None`` defers to the module-level
            default (``BENCH_HOLD_INTERVAL_SEC``, see
            ``devops_bench.evalharness.hold``).
        hold_window_sec: Length, in seconds, of the post-run soak window for
            an ``objective`` entry in ``hold`` mode. Required in that case:
            there is no default, since a silent default would quietly
            consume the shared post-run verification budget
            (``VERIFICATION_TOTAL_BUDGET_SEC``) on every task in a suite. Not
            allowed for a ``safeguard`` entry in ``hold`` mode, whose window
            is always the agent's turn; setting it there would be
            meaningless and silently ignored, which would mislead.
    The display fields (``title``, ``description``, ``group``, ``failure_hint``)
    exist so a result viewer can say what a failed check means without reading
    the check tree. They never affect scoring or matching: ``name`` remains the
    identity a chaos ``verify:`` resolves against. ``Task`` enforces the
    cross-cutting rules on them (no placeholders, ``group`` declared under the
    task's ``check_groups``, required once the task is validated).

    Attributes:
        title: Short human label, e.g. ``"team-alpha/web has a CPU limit"``.
        description: One sentence stating the condition a passing run satisfies.
        group: Slug of the task-level ``check_groups`` entry this check belongs to.
        failure_hint: What a failure usually means, from the author who knows
            the common wrong paths.
