    """Orchestrate a background chaos disruption and its verification.

    The manager runs on a daemon thread alongside the agent under test: it
    waits on the typed trigger, drives the typed
    :class:`~devops_bench.chaos.base.Fault` (via ``action.inject``) to inject
    the planned disruption, then resolves the spec's ``verify:`` key against the
    per-task verification mapping and runs
    :meth:`~devops_bench.verification.VerifierAgent.wait_for_condition` on the
    resolved node. The ``kubectl port-forward`` the load fault needs to reach
    its target is owned by the fault, not the manager — the manager only threads
    the target deployment / namespace onto ``ctx.env`` so the fault can open it.

    Args:
        target_deployment: Deployment the load fault should port-forward and
            disrupt; threaded onto ``ctx.env`` for the fault.
        namespace: Namespace the deployment lives in; threaded onto ``ctx.env``.
        verification_mapping: Name-keyed mapping of verification specs the
            chaos ``verify:`` reference is resolved against. The mapping carries
            already-validated :class:`VerificationSpec` instances (or any value
            ``VerifierAgent.wait_for_condition`` accepts); the manager never
            re-validates. Empty mapping disables verification lookups.
        skip_port_forward: When True, the fault runs without opening a
            ``kubectl port-forward``. The E2E smoke harness (against
            :class:`~devops_bench.deployers.NoOpDeployer`) flips this on so
            tests can exercise the wiring without a real cluster.

    Attributes:
        chaos_active_event: Set by the chaos fault once the disruption is
            observably active, so the harness can synchronize the operator
            agent's start.
