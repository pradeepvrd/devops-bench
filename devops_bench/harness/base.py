    A harness sits above every component (deployers, agents, chaos, verification,
    metrics) and threads them together for each task: provision infrastructure,
    optionally start a background chaos scenario, run the agent under test,
    collect artifacts, tear down, then score and report. It owns the
    :class:`~devops_bench.core.RunContext` carried across these phases.

    Concrete harnesses implement :meth:`run` to execute a batch of typed
    :class:`~devops_bench.tasks.Task` objects; :meth:`make_context` is a helper
    for building the per-task context.
