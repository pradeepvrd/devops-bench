    disrupted — which passes, and records a satisfied objective for a fault

        """Evaluate every entry against the live cluster after the agent finishes.

        Every entry runs, unconditionally, whether or not a chaos fault
        references it — *except* an entry named in ``invalidated``, whose
        chaos disruption never landed. Evaluating that one here would measure
        an undisturbed cluster and record a pass for a fault that did not
        happen, so it is recorded as never-observed instead. One entry that
        raises is recorded as a failure and the rest still run, matching how
        the metrics pipeline isolates a failing evaluator.

        Two budgets apply. ``timeout_sec`` is the per-entry cap for a single
        converging entry's checks. :data:`VERIFICATION_TOTAL_BUDGET_SEC`
        bounds the converging entries as a group; without it a task with many
        failing converge objectives burns entries x ``timeout_sec`` (12
        entries x 120s is 22+ minutes). It is not a cap on the pass as a
        whole: each assert entry runs outside the budget and pushes the
        deadline out by its own duration, so the worst case is the total
        budget plus the sum of those durations, and an assert leaf floors its
        own kubectl call rather than inheriting a zero budget (see
        :func:`~devops_bench.verification.base.single_call_timeout`).

        A single monotonic deadline is computed from the total budget once at
        the top, and the converging entries **share** what remains of it: each
        gets ``min(timeout_sec, remaining / converging_entries_left)``. Sharing
        is what keeps the total cap from being consumed first-come-first-served,
        where a handful of early entries polling to their own cap leave the
        rest unevaluated and silently drop out of the score's denominator. The
        share is recomputed from the live remaining time, so an entry that
        finishes early hands its unused budget back to the ones after it.
        Assert entries ignore the total budget and always run: they are single
        evaluations, and a safeguard that goes unchecked defeats the point of
        having it.

        A converging entry whose share came in under ``timeout_sec`` and did
        not converge is recorded ``"error"``, not ``"fail"``. Such an entry
        fails only by reaching a deadline, and a truncated deadline is one this
        pass imposed rather than one the task agreed to: the condition was not
        observed false, it was not observed. Scoring it as a miss would trade
        the old symptom (correctness computed from a fraction of the
        objectives, with coverage visibly low) for a subtler one: full-looking
        coverage over failures the harness never saw. A converging entry with
        less than :data:`MIN_LEAF_BUDGET_SECONDS` remaining is likewise
        recorded as budget-exhausted rather than handed to ``run_entry``: the
        runner's own leaf guard uses that same threshold to short-circuit an
        under-budget leaf as a definite "deadline exhausted" outcome, and this
        entry was never observed either way.

        A ``hold`` entry is never evaluated with a single ``run_entry`` call
        here, but the two roles reach their observation differently.  A
        ``safeguard`` hold entry was already sampled on a background thread
        across the agent's turn (see
        ``devops_bench.evalharness.hold.SafeguardMonitor``), and its outcome
        comes entirely from ``hold_observations``. An ``objective`` hold
        entry is soaked right here instead, via
        :func:`~devops_bench.evalharness.hold.run_hold_window`, against this
        same total-budget deadline: an objective starts false and must
        become true and stay true, which can only be observed after the
        agent's turn ends. A hold entry with zero samples either way is
        recorded as an error, not a silent pass: a hold nobody watched must
        not read as one that held.

        Args:
            entries: The task's parsed verification entries.
            timeout_sec: Per-entry budget for converging entries.
            invalidated: ``{entry_name: reason}`` for entries whose chaos
                disruption never landed, as returned by
                :func:`chaos_invalidated_entries`. Those entries are recorded

                ``safeguard``-role ``hold`` entry, as returned by

        stays inside the directory the harness already diffs), asks the

        kubeconfig from that plan, and discovers the task's seeded fixture

        is part of the boundary, not a convenience: an under-provisioned agent
        hunts for its missing input (see the proposal doc's first observed
        incident).

        The plan carries a context pin, so a current-context switched after
        provisioning (an operator mid-run, a parallel harness's ``up()``) can
        never hand the container another cluster's credential.

            creds_dir: Directory (outside the workspace) for the generated

            provider: The deployer's provider, or ``None`` when it has none.
            pod_security: The task's declared ``agent_pod_security`` level.
