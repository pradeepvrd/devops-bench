        kubeconfig server URL is not automatically meaningful: a local cluster
        typically publishes its apiserver on host loopback, which resolves to
        the container itself. Only the provider knows whether its endpoint
        already routes and, if not, what to substitute.

        The default suits any cluster whose endpoint is reachable from an
        ordinary bridge-networked container — every cloud provider, and a
        vcluster exposed on a routable address. The sandbox additionally
        rewrites a *loopback* server to ``host.docker.internal`` on top of
        whatever is returned here, so a provider only overrides this when it
        needs something that generic step cannot infer: a Docker network to
        join, an in-network hostname, or a context pin.

            cluster_info: The provisioned cluster to reach.

        Some tasks require cloud API calls beyond ``kubectl`` — adding a
        Secret Manager secret version, resizing a node pool. The sandbox
        strips the operator's ambient cloud identity by design, so those
        calls need their own credential: a short-lived token for the narrow,
        run-unique identity the task's stack provisioned and recorded on
        ``cluster_info.agent_cloud_identity``.

        The default is the correct answer for every task that names no such
        identity: nothing crosses. A provider overrides this to mint for its
        own cloud, and must fail loud when the identity is named but a
        credential cannot be produced — an agent silently missing the
        credential its task depends on gets graded on the wrong failure.
