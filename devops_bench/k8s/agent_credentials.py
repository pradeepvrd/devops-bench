"""Mint the scoped cluster credential a sandboxed agent is given.

The sandbox's first iteration mounted the operator's own kubeconfig
credential, which on every provider this benchmark uses is cluster-admin. The
container boundary was therefore doing all the work and the RBAC boundary
none: an agent that got a shell out of the container — or simply used the
credential as intended — held the whole cluster. This module replaces that
with a ServiceAccount token minted for the run: scoped by RBAC, short-lived,
and expired by the time anyone could reuse it.

It is also what makes GKE reachable from inside a container at all. A GKE
kubeconfig authenticates through ``gke-gcloud-auth-plugin``, an ``exec:``
credential plugin needing a ``gcloud`` binary and Application Default
Credentials — both of which the container deliberately lacks, and neither of
which it can be given without handing back the cloud identity the sandbox
exists to withhold. A bearer token needs no plugin, so the rendered kubeconfig
is self-contained.

Everything here runs HOST-SIDE, under the operator's credentials, before the
agent starts. Every call is pinned to the run's own kubectl context, which is
what puts the identity in the right cluster: under vcluster the host and
virtual clusters both appear in the operator's kubeconfig, and creating the
ServiceAccount in the virtual one is what makes its token cryptographically
useless against the host.

What provisioning writes, teardown removes — same names, same module, so the
two cannot drift apart unnoticed (a unit test holds the teardown inventory to
the manifests). Teardown is a correctness requirement, not hygiene: the
pod-security policy is deliberately not username-scoped (a pod may be created
on the agent's behalf by a controller under another identity), so on a REUSED
cluster a surviving policy denies the *operator's* next privileged workload
too — the first live validation hit exactly that.

Review rule (see ``docs/proposals/agent-sandboxing.md``): no cloud CLI —
``gcloud``, ``aws``, ``az`` — is invoked anywhere in this module. Everything
it does is plain Kubernetes API surface reached through ``kubectl``, so it
behaves identically on every provider and adds no cloud dependency to the
credential path.

# broke, because three were empty and the fourth runs an unprivileged metrics
# scraper — but a cluster using DRA or TPUs puts a privileged, hostPath
# DaemonSet in one of them, and a fail-closed policy would deny it.
#
# Prefix matching is what that wants and is not available: a label selector
# has no prefix operator, so the binding below cannot express
# ``gke-managed-*``. Keying off the addon manager's own label is better than

# The admission-policy backstop, denying the escape the proposal observed:
# a privileged pod with a hostPath mount, used to read the bench checkout off
# the node's disk.
#
# PSA labels alone cannot cover this. A label is per-namespace, applied to the
# namespaces that exist when the agent starts — but the agent can create a
# namespace afterwards (``deploy-hello-app`` literally asks it to) and that
# one carries no label. A ValidatingAdmissionPolicy is cluster-wide and
# therefore proof against namespaces that do not exist yet. It also sidesteps
# a collision: ``deploy-hello-app``'s verifier asserts ``enforce=restricted``
# on its namespace, which the labeller must not clobber.
#
# ``failurePolicy: Fail`` because a control that fails open is not a control.
# The binding exempts the system namespaces by name, so a CEL evaluation error
# can cost the agent a pod but cannot wedge the cluster's own components.
#
# ``pods/ephemeralcontainers`` is matched alongside ``pods`` because it is a
# distinct subresource: a rule naming only ``pods`` matches the empty
# subresource, so without this ``kubectl debug --profile=sysadmin`` would
# attach a privileged container to an existing pod and never reach the
# ``ephemeralContainers`` validation below. ``object`` is the whole Pod on that
# subresource, so the same expressions apply unchanged.
#
# The second policy closes the other way past a name-based exemption: the agent
# can create namespaces, and several exempt names do not exist on every
# provider (``gmp-system`` on kind, ``local-path-storage`` on GKE), so it could
# simply claim one and deploy there. It is a separate policy with its own
# unselected binding because the pod policy's ``namespaceSelector`` would
# otherwise exempt the very creation being guarded. Scoping it to the agent's
# own username via ``matchConditions`` is safe here in a way it would NOT be
# for pods: a namespace is always created by whoever asked, whereas a pod may
# be created on the agent's behalf by a controller running as another identity.
#
# It covers UPDATE as well as CREATE, which the name half alone would not need
# — a name is immutable, so a namespace cannot be renamed into an exemption.
# A label can be added to one at any time, and the agent holds ``update`` and
# ``patch`` on namespaces, so exempting by ``_ADDON_MANAGER_LABEL`` without
# this would hand it a one-command escape: label a namespace it already owns
# and every pod in it stops being checked.
#
# The third policy is the one that makes the exemption safe at all, and it is
# here because a probe showed the first two were not enough. Guarding the
# *names* leaves the namespaces that already exist wide open: ``edit`` is bound
# cluster-wide, so the agent can write to ``kube-system`` on any cluster, and
# the pod policy deliberately skips it. ``kubectl run --privileged
# -n kube-system`` was therefore admitted on a cluster carrying the full policy
# set — the exact escape this module exists to deny, reachable by appending a
# flag. So the agent is denied workload writes into the exempt namespaces
# outright, which is what the "cannot write to" claim above always assumed.
#
# Scoped to the agent's username, because the cluster's own components must
# keep running: the exemption exists for kube-proxy and the CNI, not for
# whoever asks. Username scoping is sound here for the same reason it is for
# namespaces and is NOT for the pod policy — a controller never creates a pod
# in these namespaces on the agent's behalf, since the workload object it would
# have to be told to create is itself denied, at the agent's own username, one
# admission earlier.
#
# It covers every kind that can produce a pod rather than pods alone, because
# a Deployment reaches the same place with the pod created by the ReplicaSet
# controller under an identity of its own; and ``pods/exec`` alongside them,
# because ``edit`` grants exec and half the pods in ``kube-system`` are
# privileged, so a shell in one is the same escape by a longer route. It does
# not cover config: a ConfigMap in ``kube-system`` is a blast-radius question,
# not an escape, and denying those would break tasks for no boundary gain.
#
# Two bindings, because it has to select exactly what the pod policy skips and
# a ``namespaceSelector`` ANDs its expressions. "Not by name AND not by label"
# inverts to "by name OR by label", and an OR takes one binding each. Scoping
# by selector rather than testing ``namespaceObject`` in the expression also
# keeps ``failurePolicy: Fail`` cheap: a CEL error here can only block agent
# writes to namespaces where they are denied anyway, instead of every pod on
# the cluster.

    ValidatingAdmissionPolicy backs them up cluster-wide, covering namespaces

    Runs at the end of every sandboxed task, and again from provisioning's own
    failure path when it raised after its first cluster write. Both callers
    sit on paths where a second failure must not eclipse the first, so this
    never raises: every step is attempted regardless of the ones before it,
    failures are logged with the object they stranded, and the return value
    says whether the cluster came out clean.

    Order matters at the front: the policy BINDINGS go first, because a
    binding is what makes a policy enforce — with the bindings gone the
    cluster stops denying anyone immediately, and everything after is
    bookkeeping. The namespace goes last, and with kubectl's default wait, so
    the next run's ``apply`` on a reused cluster cannot race a Terminating
    ``bench-system`` and fail with "object is being deleted".

        True when every object is confirmed removed (already-absent counts —
