  Use when the user adds or changes a benchmark TASK and asks to review it — e.g.
  "review this new task", "is this task parallel-safe", "review this
  task.yaml + stack", "will this task collide under the matrix", "check my new
  tf/prebuilt stack". Reviews a newly added/changed `tasks/**/task.yaml` together
  with its TF stack across schema/metadata, spec parsing, outcome rubric,
  parallel-safety (the emphasis), infra leak prevention, placeholders, and flags —
  returning ranked findings with severity + file:line evidence + a concrete fix.
  Review-only: static analysis plus unit tests / spec-parse checks; it NEVER
  provisions infra or runs an eval. For a review of harness/library CODE, use the
  sibling `devops-bench-review` skill instead.

# benchmark task review

Review a **new or changed benchmark task** — its `tasks/**/task.yaml` and the TF
stack it points at — and return findings a maintainer would act on. Each finding is
**severity (blocker / major / minor / nit) + `file:line` evidence + a concrete,
actionable fix**, scoped to the change, plus **how to verify**. Don't nitpick.

Read these as the source of truth; don't reconstruct them from memory:
- [add-a-task](../../../docs/how-to/add-a-task.md) — the `Task` schema, the fixed
  placeholder set, and the authoring flow.
- [known-issues](../../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md) — the "Before any retry"
  cleanup and the parallel-safety hazards (deterministic node-SA, leaked AR repos,
  stale run state). Cross-reference any hazard you flag.
- `devops_bench/core/run_env.py` (`RunEnv`) — **the isolation source of truth.**
  Confirm what a run gets for free before asserting a collision is or isn't covered.

Review-only: you **may** run schema/spec-parse checks and `uv run pytest`, from
the project root; you must **not** run `tofu`, cloud provider CLIs, `kind`, or `kubectl`, or
launch an eval. Assess solvability, teardown, and parallel-safety by **reading**
the stack and scripts — never by provisioning. If a capability is needed, consult
[harness-capabilities](../../references/harness-capabilities.md) and degrade to
doing it inline.

## Checklist

### Schema / metadata

Loads against the `Task` schema (validate by parsing, not by eye — typo'd keys are
silently dropped). `task_id` is **globally unique** (`grep -rn '^task_id\|^id:'
tasks/`). The task's **directory basename is globally unique** across `tasks/**`
(compare parent dir names of every `tasks/**/task.yaml`) — the matrix runner keys
run IDs, cluster names, and output dirs on the folder name, not `task_id`, so
`tasks/gcp/foo` and `tasks/kind/foo` collide even with distinct ids. Required
fields present: `task_id`, `name`, `prompt`, `expected_output`,
`infrastructure`. `infrastructure.deployer` is `tofu` or `noop` — **`noop` only for
manifest-generation tasks** (no cluster). For `tofu`, `infrastructure.stack`
resolves to an existing `tf/prebuilt/<dir>` (confirm the directory exists).

### Display metadata

A validated task carries `title`, `summary`, `category`, and every
`verification_spec` entry carries `title` and `description`; an unvalidated task
may omit them, and that is not a finding. Where present they are written for a
result viewer, not the agent: plain English, outcome not method, no
`{{placeholders}}` and a `category` from the schema's `CATEGORIES` (the schema
rejects both). Every `group` names a declared `check_groups` key. A
`failure_hint` should describe the common wrong path, not restate the
description. *Why:* these fields are the only thing a leaderboard can show next
to a failed check.

### Spec parsing

`verification_spec` / `chaos_spec` parse against the registries (`VERIFIERS`,
`FAULTS`, `TRIGGERS`) — every leaf `type` is a registered verifier/fault/trigger.
Every chaos entry's `verify:` names a **real `verification_spec` entry's `name`** —
a dangling ref doesn't crash, it's silently recorded as a parse error, so a typo is
a finding. *Why:* a mismatched cross-ref means the chaos you injected is never
actually asserted.

### Outcome-based rubric

`expected_output` grades on the **outcome** and accepts **all valid remediation
paths**. Flag a single-path rubric ("must run `kubectl rollout undo`") — that tests
recall, not capability; rewrite it to credit any path that reaches the goal. Nothing
in-cluster should *name* the fix (the agent must discover it). *Split deterministic
vs subjective:* a deterministic, checkable fact (pod healthy, replicas ≥ N, secret
rotated) belongs in a **verifier**, not the prose rubric; leave subjective quality
to the judge.

### Parallel-safety (critical)

The matrix runs **Task × Model × AgentConfig** concurrently on one host. `RunEnv`
isolates each run; a task is unsafe when it names state shared *outside* that
isolation. **What `RunEnv` sets directly — do NOT hardcode these:** `KUBECONFIG`,
`CLOUDSDK_CONFIG`, `TF_DATA_DIR` (+ tofu state beside it), and the **cluster
name** (run-token-prefixed, clamped to the framework's `_MAX_CLUSTER_NAME` — 40
chars, set by the tightest provider limit). It also publishes `BENCH_RUN_DIR`
and `BENCH_PARALLEL`, which downstream components read to derive their own
isolation: the openclaw agent's `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` and the harness's chaos
port-forward port. Those two are just as unsafe to pin, but you verify them at
the consumer, not in `run_env.py`.
Flag any task/stack/prompt that pins one of these to a fixed value.

**What the author MUST guarantee** (none of this is isolated for you):

1. **Every globally-unique cloud resource name is run-scoped.** Service accounts,
   AR repos, Cloud SQL instances, external IPs, buckets — a fixed name means
   `409 already exists` the moment a second run starts. Which discriminator is
   acceptable depends on who destroys the resource:
   - **Terraform manages it** — a `random_id` suffix is enough, since `tofu
     destroy` knows what it owns and never has to search for it by name.
   - **A teardown sweep removes it** (anything created outside the stack's
     managed resources) — it must carry `var.cluster_name` or an equivalent
     ownership label. A random suffix prevents collisions but does not say
     *which run* owns the resource, so the sweep in item 2 cannot select it
     without risking a sibling run's resources.
2. **Teardown sweeps project-global resources the stack doesn't own.** Anything an
   agent or seed script creates outside the stack's managed resources (e.g. a
   `hello-app-*` AR repo) survives `tofu destroy` — the stack needs a destroy-time
   sweep, or teardown leaks (see the leaked-AR-repo sweep in known-issues §2). The
   sweep must filter on the run's own token (`var.cluster_name` or an equivalent
   ownership label) — an unscoped sweep deletes a sibling run's resources while
   that run is still using them.
3. **Namespace consistency.** The namespace must match across the prompt's
   `{{NAMESPACE}}`, the stack's `variables.namespace`, and any matrix override — or
   the agent and the chaos injector address different workloads.
4. **Node-SA names carry their own discriminator.** `tf/modules/cluster/gke`
   builds `account_id = "gke-nodes-<slug>-<md5(cluster_name)[:6]>"`, so two
   clusters whose names collide after slug truncation still get distinct service
   accounts. This used to be a parallel-safety blocker for multi-cluster
   tasks on this deployer and no longer is — do not flag it. A stack that names its own service
   account without such a discriminator still should be flagged. The
   `409 gke-nodes-*` router row.
5. **No per-task mutation of the shared VM service-account IAM.** A stack that
   grants a project role to the shared `openclaw-vm-sa` via
   `google_project_iam_member` in its own state: the first `tofu destroy` strips the
   binding while sibling runs still need it → mid-run auth loss.
6. **Name-length budget.** Check the *resolved* name that `RunEnv.cluster_name()`
   produces, not the raw base-plus-token sum: it already clamps to
   `_MAX_CLUSTER_NAME` and the run token is the prefix, so a long base name does
   not by itself drop the discriminator. What to verify is that any *stack-side*
   truncation preserves that prefix. Removing or rewriting the run-token prefix
   collapses two runs to one name; truncating only the base suffix does not. The
   gke module's node-SA slug is the pattern to copy — it slices from position 0
   and appends an md5 of the full name, so neither the prefix nor uniqueness is
   lost.

For each parallel finding, **state which axis triggers it** (Task / Model /
AgentConfig) and whether `RunEnv` already covers it — that's what the maintainer
acts on.

### Infra config & leak prevention

The stack has `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`. It returns what the deployer
expects (`cluster_name` / `cluster_location`; kind stacks emit
`cluster_location = "local"`). For **every project-global resource it creates** (AR
repos, Cloud SQL, external IPs, auto-mode VPCs), there is destroy-time cleanup so a
re-apply after a failed run isn't blocked by orphans. Every stack variable must
be supplied by one of two paths — `provider.resolve_variables()`, or the task's
own `infrastructure.variables`, which `TFDeployer._var_flags` forwards for any
key the stack declares. Flag a variable only when *neither* path supplies it; a
task-config key the stack never declares raises `ConfigError` at deploy time.

### Placeholders

`{{PROJECT_ID}}`, `{{CLUSTER_NAME}}`, `{{APP_LOCATION}}`,
`{{TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}`, `{{NAMESPACE}}` used **consistently** and only from
the fixed supported set — there is **no `{{REPO_PATH}}`** or other invented token (an
unknown `{{...}}` is left un-substituted and reaches the agent literally). Every
infra-specific value in the prompt/rubric/specs is a placeholder, never a hardcoded
project/cluster/namespace.

### Flags

`validated` stays **`false`** until a human has vetted the task — it gates
leaderboard eligibility (not running; an unvetted task still burns quota). Promoting
to `true` in the same change that adds the task is a finding unless the change shows
it was actually run. `generation_only` is derived from `deployer == "noop"`, so it
must match: a `noop` task is generation-only (its YAML is judged, never applied); a
`tofu` task is not.

## Verify, then present

Confirm the schema/spec actually parse (run the loader / `uv run pytest` for task
tests; note pre-existing failures aren't the author's). For each candidate, try to
**refute** it against `run_env.py` and the resolver before keeping it. Present:

1. **Overview** — what the task tests and its infra shape (deployer/stack, kind vs
   a cloud provider, chaos or not).
2. **Findings**, most-severe first, each `severity — file:line — summary` then the
   failure/why, the concrete fix, and **how to verify** (the parse to run, the
   `grep` for the duplicate id, the axis that triggers the collision).
3. **Cleared** — what you checked and found safe (e.g. "cluster name + KUBECONFIG
   inherited from RunEnv ok; namespace consistent across prompt/stack").

Scale effort to the ask: "is this parallel-safe?" wants the parallel-safety
checklist and a verdict; "review this task" wants the full checklist. Never
provision infra or run an eval to produce a finding.
