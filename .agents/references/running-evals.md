# Running evals — shared run mechanics

The single home for the run mechanics that `run-eval` and `run-parallel-evals`
reuse: where to run, how to authenticate, how to come up clean, how to launch
detached, the matrix knobs, and where results land. The skills link here instead
of repeating it.

This reference is **agent-agnostic** — it describes capabilities, not specific
tools. For the per-agent mapping (sub-agents, background runs, timers, durable
state, worktrees, asking the operator) see
[`harness-capabilities.md`](./harness-capabilities.md). For the failure router
see [`../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md`](../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md);
for how scores are computed and read, see
[`../../docs/components/metrics.md`](../../docs/components/metrics.md) — this
file does not duplicate either.

## Choosing where to run

The matrix runs on the **runner host** — the machine where you invoke the
wrapper. **Local is the default** (`nohup` on this host, no ssh/sync, outputs in
`~/matrix-runs/<stamp>`). Set **`BENCH_REMOTE=1`** to sync the working tree to
the **bastion** — a remote runner VM, reachable over standard SSH or a cloud
provider's tunneling CLI — and run there over ssh, pulling results back. The
snippets below show the bare command; in remote mode they run under the
wrapper's ssh transport, so the same paths (`~/secrets.env`,
`~/matrix-runs/<stamp>`) live on the VM.

**Bastion connection env (remote mode only).** The wrapper supports two
transports:

- **Plain `ssh`/`scp`** — any VM you can reach directly. Set
  `BASTION_SSH_HOST` (and optionally `BASTION_SSH_USER`).
- **Cloud tunnel CLI** — when `BASTION_SSH_HOST` is unset, the wrapper falls
  back to the tunneling CLI of the provider that the repo's
  `tf/modules/bastion` module targets, matching the VM it provisions:

  ```bash
  export BASTION_VM=<your-vm> BASTION_ZONE=<zone> BASTION_PROJECT=<proj>
  ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **On the tunnel transport, get the bastion's identity from Terraform — don't
> assume the wrapper's built-in defaults.** The bastion is provisioned from
> `tf/modules/bastion`, which exports
> an `iap_ssh_command` output — `tofu output iap_ssh_command` in the root
> module where you instantiated it prints the exact connect command with the
> real name, zone, and project. Set
> `BASTION_VM` / `BASTION_ZONE` / `BASTION_PROJECT` from that, and verify the
> host is up before blaming credentials for a connection failure. Use
> `REMOTE_DIR=devops-bench-<label>` to avoid clobbering another session's
> checkout on the VM.

## Authentication

Pick one mode:

- **Cloud IAM / instance-role credentials** — the runner host's ambient
  credentials; no key handling, and the only mode that stays portable across
  the isolated per-run state dirs parallel runs create. Set `BENCH_VERTEX=1`
  and **no API keys**: the runner unsets every API key `~/secrets.env`
  exported so agents and judges fall back to the runner host's ambient
  credentials (on the bastion, the VM's service account), then exports the
  provider env the model backend needs — project, location (**`global`**), and
  the portable ambient-credential marker (see the router in
  [known_issues.md](../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md)); the exact variable
  names live in the wrapper.
- **API keys** — the runner sources `~/secrets.env` on the runner host when
  present (`set -a`, so plain assignments export). Put the keys your providers
  need there — `AGENT_API_KEY` for the agent contract, `GEMINI_API_KEY` /
  `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for the google model provider (which also serves the judge).
  Check names only — **never print key values**; ask the operator for a missing
  key rather than guessing.

**Judge.** The wrapper defaults `JUDGE_PROVIDER=google` and
`JUDGE_MODEL=gemini-3.1-pro-preview` — the id the API-key endpoint publishes,
because that is the path the bastion actually uses. Vertex publishes the id
without the suffix, so a Vertex-backed run overrides it to `gemini-3.1-pro`.
Getting this wrong used to be silent; `preflight_models` now makes one call to
the judge and the chaos driver before anything is provisioned, so a bad id
fails in seconds instead of after a whole matrix. If judge calls return 404 or
silently fail, work the `404 Publisher model` row in
[known_issues.md](../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md) — it carries the full
fix (the location and model-id requirements).

**Chaos driver.** `CHAOS_MODEL` needs the same treatment, and it is easy to
miss because the judge and the chaos driver do not resolve models the same way.
The judge reaches Vertex, where `gemini-3.1-pro` exists; the chaos driver goes
through the API key, whose endpoint publishes only `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` and
answers `gemini-3.1-pro` with `404 ... is not found for API version v1beta`. A
judge that works is therefore no evidence that chaos will.

The failure does not look like a bad model id. The fault never injects, the run
is recorded `verification_status: chaos_invalidated`, and correctness is
withheld — which reads as "the spike did not land" rather than "the driver
could not call a model". Only `optimize-scale` declares a chaos spec, so it is
the only task that shows it. Check `chaos_report.error` in `results.json`
before treating an invalidated spike as an infrastructure problem.

## Clean-environment pre-flight

Stale per-run state and orphaned cloud resources are the most common cause of a
"fresh" run failing instantly. Before **every** launch or retry, work the
**"Before any retry" checklist** in
[`known_issues.md`](../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md) — don't re-derive it
here, and keep it **scoped to the run you are retrying**: runs execute
concurrently on a shared host, so unscoped wipes (`rm -rf
/tmp/devops-bench-runs/*`, deleting every kind cluster, a bare `pkill`) take out
sibling runs.

For orphaned **cloud** resources (clusters, node service accounts (e.g.
`gke-nodes-*`), leaked secrets), use the
[`cleanup-orphaned-resources`](../skills/cleanup-orphaned-resources/SKILL.md)
skill rather than re-listing them inline.

## Launching (detached)

`scripts/bastion/run_matrix.sh` (Task × Model × AgentConfig)
runs the matrix **detached under `nohup`** (staged as
`~/.matrix-runner-<stamp>.sh`, log at `~/matrix-runs/<stamp>.out`), polls for
the `~/matrix-runs/<stamp>/.done` marker, and pulls results in remote mode. It
prints a `STAMP` (`<YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS>-<pid>`) on launch — record
`RESUME_STAMP=<stamp>` in durable state; it is your handle for monitoring and
re-attach. If your poller dies the detached run keeps going — re-attach with
`RESUME_STAMP=<stamp>` and the same command. A **retry is a new launch**: run
it *without* `RESUME_STAMP` (set, the wrapper attaches to the old run instead
of launching), then record the new `STAMP` as the active attempt.

**Always `DRY_RUN=1` first** — it prints the expanded matrix + per-combo env
without provisioning (and without requiring `PROJECT_ID`), so a typo in
`MATRIX_MODELS` costs nothing instead of clusters.

Example (vendor-neutral: API keys from `~/secrets.env`, local runner; the
default task provisions on kind, so no cloud cluster is spent):

```bash
PROJECT_ID=<proj> \
MAX_PARALLEL=3 MATRIX_TASKS="tasks/common/opa-remediation/task.yaml" \
MATRIX_MODELS="<model-id> <model-id-2>" \
MATRIX_AGENT_CONFIGS="oc+mcp+skills" \
RESULTS_DIR="results/<label>" \
  scripts/bastion/run_matrix.sh
```

Provider-specific example (ambient credentials on the Vertex model backend;
other backends can be added analogously; prefix `BENCH_REMOTE=1` + the
`BASTION_*` env for remote):

```bash
PROJECT_ID=<proj> BENCH_VERTEX=1 \
JUDGE_MODEL=gemini-3.1-pro-preview \
MAX_PARALLEL=3 MATRIX_TASKS="tasks/common/opa-remediation/task.yaml" \
MATRIX_MODELS="gemini-3.1-pro-preview gemini-3.5-flash" \
MATRIX_AGENT_CONFIGS="gcli+mcp+skills oc+mcp+skills" \
RESULTS_DIR="results/<label>" \
  scripts/bastion/run_matrix.sh
```

## Run identity

Under `--parallel` (the matrix always sets it via `BENCH_PARALLEL=true`), each
run is isolated by `RunEnv` (`devops_bench/core/run_env.py`):

- **Run id** — `RUN_ID` env if set (the matrix sets it to the combo's `rid`),
  else `<YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS>-<pid>`. The matrix derives `rid` from the task's
  **directory basename**, so never select two tasks whose directories share a
  basename in one matrix — they would collide on run id, cluster name, and
  output dir.
- **Per-run state** — `/tmp/devops-bench-runs/<RUN_ID>/` (override the root with
  `BENCH_RUN_STATE_ROOT`): kubeconfig, cloud CLI config, tofu data dir.
- **Cluster name** — `<token>-<CLUSTER_NAME>`, where the token is `c` + 7 hex
  chars derived from the run id. Deterministic: **the same combo always maps to
  the same cluster name**, which is why two runs of the *same* combo must never
  overlap. The cluster module names its node service account
  `gke-nodes-<slug:9>-<md5(cluster_name):6>` (`tf/modules/cluster/gke/main.tf`).

## Matrix knobs

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MATRIX_TASKS` | Space-separated `task.yaml` paths, or `ALL` to enumerate every task. Default `tasks/common/opa-remediation/task.yaml`. |
| `MATRIX_MODELS` | Space-separated model ids. Default `gemini-3.1-pro`. |
| `MATRIX_AGENT_CONFIGS` | Each `oc\|gcli` `[+mcp][+skills]`, where `oc` is the config token for the OpenClaw agent and `gcli` for the Gemini CLI agent (e.g. `gcli+mcp+skills`). Default `oc+mcp+skills`. |
| `MAX_PARALLEL` | Max combos running at once (default `3`). Each combo is its own cluster — mind quota. |
| `PROJECT_ID` | Cloud project for the run. **Required** unless `DRY_RUN=1`. |
| `CLUSTER_NAME` | Base cluster name (default `eval`); per-run names are derived from it (see *Run identity*). |
| `AGENT_TIMEOUT_SEC` | Per-agent timeout (default `1200` in the matrix; the harness's own default of 600s is too low for infra-bearing tasks). |
| `BENCH_VERTEX` | Run agents + judges on the runner host's ambient cloud credentials instead of API keys (currently implemented for Vertex/ADC). |
| `BENCH_REMOTE` | Run on the bastion over ssh; unset runs every combo locally. |
| `SKIP_SYNC` | Skip the working-tree sync to the bastion (after one real sync). |
| `BASTION_VM` / `BASTION_ZONE` / `BASTION_PROJECT` | Bastion identity for the cloud tunnel transport. Don't rely on the wrapper's built-in defaults — set all three from the Terraform output (see *Choosing where to run*). |
| `BASTION_SSH_HOST` / `BASTION_SSH_USER` | Plain-ssh transport for any directly reachable VM (bypasses the cloud tunnel). |
| `REMOTE_DIR` | Checkout dir on the VM (default `devops-bench`). Set a per-run value to avoid clobbering another session's checkout. |
| `RESULTS_DIR` | Where pulled results land in remote mode (default `results/matrix`). |
| `MCP_SERVER_BIN` | Cluster-aware MCP server binary for `+mcp` combos (default: none — `+mcp` combos need it set; e.g. a provider-specific server such as `gke-mcp` when the cluster provider is GKE). |
| `SKILLS_PATHS` | Skills directories for `+skills` combos (default: none — no skills are loaded unless set). |
| `DRY_RUN` | Print the expanded matrix + per-combo env without provisioning. |
| `RESUME_STAMP` | Skip launching; re-poll + pull an existing run by its stamp. |
| `MATRIX_POLL_TIMEOUT_SEC` | Give up polling after this long (default `86400`); the detached run itself is unaffected. |

---

## Where results land

Per combo on the runner host: `~/matrix-runs/<stamp>/<rid>/` with `status`
(`exit=<rc>` once finished), `run.log`, and a `run_<ts>_<rid>/` subdirectory
holding `results.json` (the judged per-criterion scores), `rows.json`, and
`manifest.json`. In remote mode the whole stamped dir is pulled back to
`RESULTS_DIR/<stamp>/`. A bare CLI run (`python -m devops_bench <task>`)
instead writes a single timestamped `run_<ts>_…/` directory under
`RESULTS_ROOT` (default `results/`) — suffixed with the run id when one is set,
else with sub-second precision.

[`../../docs/components/metrics.md`](../../docs/components/metrics.md).
