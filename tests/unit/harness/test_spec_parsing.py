"""Harness parses opaque task blobs into typed component contracts.

CONVENTIONS.md §3 / §4: every Layer-2 seam consumes a **typed** node, so the
harness must convert the opaque ``chaos_spec`` / ``verification_spec`` blobs
(``Any`` at the Layer-1 task boundary) into ``ChaosSpec`` / ``VerificationSpec``
at its own boundary.
