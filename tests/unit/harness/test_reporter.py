"""Golden tests for the preserved ``results.json`` schema (Decision D3).

Two invariants are pinned here:

1. **The ``ResultReporter`` writes the input list verbatim.** The reporter is
   a thin sink the engine depends on (``harness-refactor-handoff.md`` §8);
   it must not reshape the payload.
2. **Success and failed records carry the *same* top-level key set.** A
   downstream parser iterating one shape can never ``KeyError`` crossing
   into the other. The tests drive the production code path by invoking
   :meth:`DefaultHarness._build_success_record` /
   :meth:`DefaultHarness._build_failed_record` on a stub
   :class:`AgentResult` and asserting ``set(record.keys()) == required_keys``.
   A hand-rolled dict would let the builders drift silently — these tests
   intentionally exercise the real builders.
